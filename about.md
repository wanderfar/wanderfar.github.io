Hey there! This site is inspired by a quote from one of J.R.R. Tolkein's poems _"All That is Gold Does Not Glitter"_ included in The Lord of the Rings, and reads:

>All that is gold does not glitter,
**Not all those who wander are lost;**
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.
Thanks for reading!
