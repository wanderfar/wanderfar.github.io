  Hey there! This site is inspired by a quote from one of J.R.R. Tolkein's poems: 
  >Not all those who wander are lost
</p>

*"All That is Gold Does Not Glitter"* is a poem included in The Lord of the Rings, and reads:

>All that is gold does not glitter,

Not all those who wander are lost;

The old that is strong does not wither,

Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,

A light from the shadows shall spring;

Renewed shall be blade that was broken,

The crownless again shall be king.

Thanks for reading!
